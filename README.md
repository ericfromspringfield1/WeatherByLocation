# WeatherByLocation
User can search current weather by city or zip code. 

Dewpoint is not key:value data, but calculated using a formula that considers humidity and temperature. Only showing if the humidity is over 50%. Otherwise, the formula is inaccurate. 

Various emojis are renedered depending on the dewpoint. 

Images change based on the current weather. I used a Switch Statement to define each image to go along with each corresponding  weather condition.
