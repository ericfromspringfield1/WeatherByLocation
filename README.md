# WeatherByLocation
User can search current weather by city or zip code. 

Dew point is not key:value data, but calculated using a formula that considers humidity and temperature. Only showing if the humidity is over 50%. Otherwise, the formula is inaccurate. 

Various emojis are rendered depending on the dew point. 

Images change based on the current weather. I used a Switch Statement to define each image to go along with each corresponding  weather condition.
